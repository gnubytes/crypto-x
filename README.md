# About crypto-x
A simple script for including the price of crypto-currencies in your Gnu/Linux XFCE panel.

# Why I created this script
I created this script because I found it difficult (and oftentimes irritating) to find a script that integrates a simple bitcoin price monitor into the panel for the GNU/Linux XFCE desktop environment and the associated XCFE panel. There are a plentiful supply of bitcoin monitors for tiling window managers on Github but not many for full stack desktop environments. This project attempts to remedy that.
